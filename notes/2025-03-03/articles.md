## Learning ground state MPS representations using genetic algorithms(Yijia)

Link: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00497](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00497)

Short summary: Current approaches for finding MPS representations of ground states typically rely on repeated Hamiltonian acts or variational methods. This paper presents an alternative approach where they first establish some fundamental patterns of tensor generation, then employ genetic algorithms to train the representative MPS, yielding promising results.
